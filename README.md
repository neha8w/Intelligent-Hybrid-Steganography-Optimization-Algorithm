Project Title: Intelligent Hybrid Steganography Optimization Algorithm

Digital image steganography refers to the practice of hiding secret messages into digital images with the intention of secret communication.
Steganography process hides the encrypted data such that nobody can suspect that there exists secret data.
Normally, the steganography system includes three components such as cover-object, secret data, and stego-object.
It considers three parameters for the processing which means capacity, security, and image quality.
The project aims to implement encryption of secret data into cover image as well as decryption of secret data from cover image using diamond encoding method.

Technologies Used:
Python, PIL, Matplotlib, TensorFlow
